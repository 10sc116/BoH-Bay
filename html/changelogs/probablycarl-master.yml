changes: 
  - balance: "Returns functionality of the Captain's sidearm, once again locking it to him alone and upping the damage to original values."
  - balance: "Augmentations have been returned, though given appropriate costs for what their functionality is."
  - balance: "To make exploration more independent, alongside giving them more utility, they've two area locked laser carbines, which are functionally identical to the Infantry Laser Carbine. The carbines are located inside the 'boomstick' locker, next to the Pilot's cabin."
  - balance: "Pathfinder's hardsuit returned to old values for ballistic protection, making it anything but the plastic suit it was turned into. Given it's an Exosuit, you'd expect it to be semi-decent."
  - rscdel: "Lawyers, Bailiff and Adjudicator has been removed. See the maptweaks for more information. We're in space, not on a colony, so frontier justice is to be expected."
  - maptweak: "Research now has, inside the maintenance tunnels west, a long term storage for biologicals and artifacts. This is to primarily be used by Expeditionary groups, so to fulfill this it permits them access. This replaces the courthouse."
  - maptweak: "Lawyer office next to cryo is now an unused location, free to be used by the crew."
  - maptweak: "Adjudicator's office is now a VIP Quarters."
  - maptweak: "Infantry returned. Their prep is now south of where it was, using an area of the old ship garden."
  - spellcheck: "'Subdural' armor is now 'Subdermal' armor."
